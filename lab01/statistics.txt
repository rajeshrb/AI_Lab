assumption:
	total expanded nodes means all those nodes which are put into closed set and it different from the finale size of closed set.
	note: some nodes are deleted from the closed i.e when a child node with better g value( better means less g) is found and it is in closed set then delete it.

	birectional:
		Manhattan heuristic: >167 for goal to source and 167 from  source to goal

	unidirectional:

		Displaced Tile: 129490
		Own: 47988
		Overestimated: 181440
	birectional:

inference:
	unidirectional search:
		1. the better heuristic the better performance and better heuristic likely to expand more nodes in the case if no path exists and it is because it tries to find the path.
		2. if h if far from h* then number of nodes expanded increases
		3. if h>h* then it is likely to find sub-oprimal path

	birectional:
		1. is there exists a node such that the search from either directions meet at this node then the performance almost reduced to 1/3
		2. it also depends on the node expanded. For example if there are more than one node with min(f) then choice of node affects the results.
